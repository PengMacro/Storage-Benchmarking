# Storage-Benchmarking
 
I benchmarked two object storage systems, namely MinIO, Ceph, and three popular key-value storage databases: MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra. The aim was to evaluate the impact of different access patterns (batch size object access), data locations (memory, disk, SSD), data formats (raw, blob, pickled data) and storage disaggregation granularity on data loading performance.
